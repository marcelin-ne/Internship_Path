This Pet Project Module 4

Use typescript to retrieve data from Github's Stack Builders organization
Using the public API

The application should show:
    * Repositories with more than 5 stars
    * Last 5 updated repositories
    * Sum of all repository stars
    * List of top 5 repositories with more stars
    * List all repositories alphabetically and remove all respositories that start with "h"
Considerations:
    * Each functionality can be a function
    * Try to make pure functions whenever possible
    * include unit test and test coverage
